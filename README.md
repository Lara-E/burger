# Eat-Da-Burger
![Alt Text](./public/assets/img/burger.png) 

Eat-Da-Burger is a full-stack MVC app that tracks burgers in a database. Users can enter a burger and add it to the Available Burgers menu. Adding a burger will automatically update the burger database. Each available burger has a 'Devour It!' button that when clicked will update the burger's status in the database and move the burger to the Burgers Eaten area.

**Note** *After cloning this repository you will need to run npm install in order for Eat-Da-Burger to work properly. You will also need to run the schema.sql in MySQL to set up your database. You may run the seeds.sql to populate your database if you wish or you can populate your database from the add burger form on the client side of the app.*
